    Police control rules (MRU & LRU: 
    I'm using the MRU (Most recently use ) and LRU (least recently use) rules to managing the data
    trieved like professor talking durng the lecture time. 
        I'm using the in_order dictionary to implementation this skill
            i.e the first element into the dictionary (OrderedDict) that is the LRU
            i.e the last  element into the dictionary that is the MRL 
    It caches pages loaded from disk and, when full, evicts the least-recently-used
    page that is not currently pinned. Dirty pages are flushed to disk before eviction.

    Function have it:
        get_page(self, table_name, page_id):
        unpin_page(self, table_name, page_id):
